<h1>Minecraft Art</h1>

<h3>Retro Re:Imagine Part 1</h3>
<br>
<br>
<p>Part 1 of Retro Re:Imagined</p>
<br>
<p>The beginning of this project was to make art using Minecraft.I first decided to create a sculpture of a 3d 8-bit Mario. Later down the line I expanded on this idea further by 
making a sculpture of a 3d 8-bit Sonic and a 3d 8-bit Link to garner the theme of old video games reintroduced in 3d art.

<h3>Minecraft Screenshots</h3>
<p> Here are some screenshots of the models I made in Minecraft.

	<h3>8-Bit Mario in 3D</h3>
      <img src="images/8-bitmario.png" alt="mario" class="img-fluid rounded" class="d-block w-80" style="width:52%">
      <h4>This was made in ART 74's Minecraft Server in Survival mode, so this took a lot longer than it shoul
          have taken. I also originally wanted to do it in Mario's modern colors, but the only material we
	      were allowed to build with was wool so I was at least able to do his original classic color palette.</h4>
    </div>
    <div class="carousel-item">
	<h3>8-bit Link in 3d</h3>
      <img src="images/8-bitlink.png" alt="link" class="img-fluid rounded" class="d-block w-80" style="width:52%">
      <h4>â€‹This was made in a differnt single player world in Minecraft. This time I wasn't constricted to the server
	      and I could be in creative mode so this was finished a lot faster the first time.</h4>
    </div>
	<div class="carousel-item">
	<h3>8-bit Sonic in 3D</h3>
      <img src="images/8-bitsonic.png" alt="sonic" class="img-fluid rounded" class="d-block w-80" style="width:52%">
      <h4>This was probably the most chalenging to construct. This is the largest model I made out of the three
	      and I went through a lot of trial and error to get things looking right and natural. Even though this was
		  made in creative mode, Sonic took just as long to make as it did making Mario in survival.</h4>
    </div>

<p>The cultural significance of my piece is that Mario, Link, and Sonic are video game icons. Everyone has played a Mario 
game before and Mario is arguably the first video game character that made video games popular in the first place.
Mario's presence in video games helped inspire other creators to create games based on his influence. 
These video game characters are what developed video game culture and I wanted to celebrate that history by making it part of my art.
